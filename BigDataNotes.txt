"In God we trust... Everyone else bring data."

When your data set extends beyond the capacity of your systems to store and
 manipulate, it's big data.
    It's a relative term. If you have a laptop and you recieve more data than your
    laptop can handle, that's big data for you. The term's meaning changes
    depending on the system.


Five Vs of Big Data:
